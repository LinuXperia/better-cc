Initial release. Windows 32-bit / 64-bit releases, and Linux Cuda 9.0 and 9.1 combined binaries are attached.

22% increased hashrate, ccminer-2.2.6. optimized for ravencoin

There is a 2% dev donation fee for the compiled binaries to support ongoing development of this project. You can opt out of the donation by compiling from source yourself (the donation fee is in donate.h).

If you'd like to contribute more than the minimum to the project, you can set the donation percentage using --donate N to donate N% of your hashrate to the dev pool.

EDIT: Fixed dev pool switching not working on Windows. Original versions would just idle for a minute; it now properly connects to the dev pool. Please re-download the Windows versions to support the project!


Fork from nevermore, ccminer
